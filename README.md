My Spring 2025 University Project to create a basic social media website that can run on AWS EC2 instance, S3 bucket, and mysql server for log in. Majority of the code was created using my own code and various AI tools such as ChatGPT.

The project's focus was to demonstrate my ability to connect multiple cloud services together and backup the project onto Github. The website itself allows for logging in, uploading images, and sharing all images the user has created. This website is functional but would need significant additions added if implimented.

Here is the youtube video of the website in operation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVa1D3a0Fi0
